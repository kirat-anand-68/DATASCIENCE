## 🧩 Project Overview
This project is designed to give a full walkthrough of the **Data Science pipeline** — collecting, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling data to derive business insights and predictions.  

It uses **Customer Purchase Behavior Data** to:
- Understand customer demographics and spending patterns  
- Predict the likelihood of purchase  
- Segment customers based on their purchasing habits  

The entire project is implemented using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Companies need to identify **potential customers** who are most likely to make a purchase.  
By understanding and analyzing past purchase data, businesses can create personalized marketing strategies and optimize their sales campaigns.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
To build a **classification model** that predicts whether a customer will make a purchase or not, based on demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
**Dataset:** `customer_data.csv`  
**Source:** [Kaggle - Customer Purchase Behavior](https://www.kaggle.com/)  

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `CustomerID` | Unique identifier for each customer |
| `Age` | Age of the customer |
| `Gender` | Male or Female |
| `Annual_Income` | Income in USD |
| `Spending_Score` | Score assigned based on spending behavior |
| `Purchased` | Target variable (1 = Purchased, 0 = Not Purchased) |
